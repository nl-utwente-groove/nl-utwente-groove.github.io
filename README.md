## Intro

GROOVE is a tool that will enable you to quickly and easily create graph transformation rules and apply them.
Its strength lies in state space generation: once you have defined a start graph and a set of transformation
rules, you can automatically apply them iteratively, generating all reachable graphs (or at least a finite
number of them).

Beyond this, GROOVE has some very powerful capabilities:

1. _Automatic isomorphism detection._
2. _Attribute manipulation._
3. _Nested graph conditions and transformation._
4. _Controlled rule application._
5. _Advanced state space exploration strategies._
6. _Model checking._
